# BreastCancerDetection
Here I have performed  exploratory data analysis on the given dataset and predicted if a person have benign or malignant tumor. I have trained two different models to predict the type of tumor. I have used K-NN and Logistic Regression. With K-NN I have got an accuracy of around 96.5% and with Logistic Regression I have got an accuracy around to 95.5%. The dataset was imbalanced so I have balanced the dataset and it contained some of outliers so I had detected the outliers and removed them. I have performed hyperparameter optimization and found the best value for K in K-NN and best value for C in Logistic Regression.Since the dataset dimmentionality was not very large hence i haven't performed dimentionality reduction.
